# Music Hacker's Toolbox

## About 

Set of Python scripts for quick collaboration with essential data from The Echo Nest and Las.fm API when creating some kind of music hack.
May be useful during Music Hack Days, when you need to quickly retrieve some ID's, pictures, last.fm charts, last.fm library data/user data, etc.. 

Each script is representing some kind of basic function.

## Future

Open for adding more functions.
