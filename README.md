# Music Hacker's Toolbox

## About 

Set of Python scripts for quick collaboration with essential data from The Echo Nest and Las.fm API when creating some kind of music hack.

May be useful during Music Hack Days, when you need to quickly retrieve some ID's, pictures, last.fm charts, last.fm library data/user data, etc.. 

Each script is representing some kind of basic function and usually *it can take two kinds of arguments: artist name/username OR list of artist names/usernames from an input file.*

## Example

`Usage: ./get-twitter-handle.py [OPTIONS]"
Gets Twitter handle from given input string (or list of strings from file), representing artist's name.
-a | --artist :: name of the artist, e.g. ("Iron Maiden")
-f | --file :: list of artists from a .txt file`

## Future

Open for adding more functions.
